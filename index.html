    <h2>Breakfast</h2>  
    <h3>Omellete</h3>
    <p> Everyone knows that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so it's pivotal that you have something nutritious to supply you with the right energy for the day's tasks, so it only makes sense that the best option would be to have an omellete.</p>

    <h2> Lunch </h2>  
    <h3> Tandoori Chicken</h3>
    <p> A personal favourite of mine due to the ridiculous burst of flavour and heartiness of the meal. Best of all, it's super simple to make yourself and could be modified to better fit with your preferences</p>

    <h2> Dinner </h2> 
    <h3> Sweet and Sour Salmon</h3>   
    <p> Everyone knows that salmon is about as good as you can get when it comes to sea food, and what better way to end the day with a splendid dish of some sweet and sour salmon fillet. Like all the other recipes so far, this one is also really easy to do and doesn't require much ingredients</p>
