    <img src="./images/tandoori-chicken.jpg" alt="Ruby Red Tandoori Chicken on a plate of rice">  
    <h3> Ingredients required </h3> 
    <ul> 
        <li> Chicken thighs or breast</li> 
        <li> Greek Yogurt </li> 
        <li> Lemon Juice</li> 
        <li> Vegetable or Canola Oil</li> 
        <li> Fresh Garlic</li>   
        <li> Onion Powder</li>
        <li> Tandoori Masala (go for the Kissan brand)</li> 

    </ul>  
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <ol>  
        <li> Wash each of your chicken thighs/breasts and score them. Place them in a large baking pan when cleaned.</li> 
        <li> Coat each of the chicken pieces with vegetable/canola oil and season the chicken with a generous amount of tandoori masala, onion powder, salt, and pepper</li> 
        <li> Rub the seasoning all over the chicken until the color of the flesh becomes a dark red. If you're someone that loves the skin, remember to rub the seasoning underneath the skin too so you don't end up with flavourless chicken. </li> 
        <li> Using half a lemon, squeeze all of it's lemon juice over the chicken and mix it with 3 spoons of greek yogurt. Again, make sure to mix everything up.</li> 
        <li> Marinade the chicken in the fridge for atleast an hour before cooking. The yogurt and lemon juice will work wonders in infusing the meat with the flavours of the seasoning while making it very tender</li> 
        <li> Heat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit and cook the chicken for about an hour.</li> 
        <li> Serve the chicken up with a plate of rice or a side of salad. It's also recommended to baste the cooked chicken with a little bit of the oil in the baking pan to greatly enhance the flavour.</li>
    </ol>
