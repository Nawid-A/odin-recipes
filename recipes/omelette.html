        <img src="../images/omelette.jpg" alt="A beautifully cooked omellete with a side of salad">
        <p class="desc"> An omelette with a generous side of salad is a nutritious breakfast that almost never gets stale and repetitive due to it's versatility.</p> 
        <h3> Ingredients required</h3> 
        <ul> 
            <li> 3 large eggs </li> 
            <li> Olive Oil</li> 
            <li> Brocoli </li> 
            <li> Italian Seasoning</li> 
            <li> Paprika (smoked paprika is also good)</li> 
        </ul>  
        <h3> Instructions </h3> 
        <ol> 
            <li> Crack the eggs in a bowl with water and wisk it until runny. You should also put in your spices into the bowl and whisk away to incorporate all the flavours</li> 
            <li> In a skillet, pour some olive oil and heat he pan to medium-low heat. Then, cook whatever toppings you'd like (in this case, it's brocoli) until satisfactory</li> 
            <li> With the cooked toppings still in the pan, pour your whisked eggs in the pan and try to spread them around as much as possible to cover the entire surface of the pan.</li> 
            <li> Cook the eggs for about 3-4 minutes on medium-low heat. Make sure to give the skillet small shakes back and forth every half a minute to ensure hat the omelette doesn't stick to the pan. (PRO TIP: For a fluffy omelette, place a lid on top of the pan while the eggs are cooking)</li> 
            <li> Remove from heat and try to fold the omelette in half using a spatula. Serve on a plate and enjoy</li>
