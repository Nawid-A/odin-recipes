    <img src="images/salmon.jpg" alt="The best god damn salmon you'll ever eat"> 
    <h3> Ingredients Required</h3> 
    <ul> 
        <li> Salmon Fillet </li> 
        <li> Fresh Garlic and Garlic Powder</li> 
        <li> Paprika </li> 
        <li> Olive oil</li> 
        <li> Soy sauce (reduced sodium preferred)</li> 
        <li> Brown sugar </li> 
        <li> Lemon juice</li> 
    </ul> 
    <ol> 
        <li> In a bowl, add your soy sauce, lemon juice and brown sugar and give it a mix. Taste test it to make sure that it isn't too sweet or sour and if so, add more brown sugar or lemon juice to counteract it.</li> 
        <li> If not done already, wash and cut your salmon fillet into three even pieces.</li>   
        <li> give each salmon piece a dry rub of your seasoning mix of paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper</li> 
        <li> Lightly coat a skillet with olive oil and heat it up to medium-low heat. When hot enough, put your salmon in the skillet skin side up first. Let it cook for 3 minutes and then flip the fillets on the skin side and let that cook for another 3 minutes.</li> 
        <li> Add chopped fresh garlic o the skillet along with your sauce mix and let it simmer with the salmon. Use a spoon to continously pour the sauce on eah of the salmon fillets until adequately coathed. </li> 
        <li> EXTRA STEP: If you plan on having some rice with your salmon, it would be best to place your cooked rice in the same pan just used to cook your salmon, add some water, and heat it up while mixing it. This gives your rice the leftover flavour of the salmon and is genuinely way better than just having plain rice</li>
